Welcome to ascii.town!

This software targets FreeBSD and Darwin.

C source files are self-compiling, e.g. ./server.c.

    torus.h        Shared structures and message protocol.
    server.c       Maps torus.dat and listens on torus.sock.
    client.c       Curses client.
    help.c         Automated client which redraws a helpful banner.

On FreeBSD with TERM=xterm-256color, the client fails to display bright
colors. Applying termcap.diff sets it equivalent to TERM=xterm.

    patch -p0 -o termcap < termcap.diff
    cap_mkdb termcap
