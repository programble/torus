torus(1)                FreeBSD General Commands Manual               torus(1)

NAME
     server, client, image, meta, merge â€“ collaborative ASCII art

SYNOPSIS
     server [-d data] [-p pidfile] [-s sock]
     client [-h] [-s sock]
     image [-k] [-d data] [-f font] [-x x] [-y y]
     meta
     merge data1 data2 data3

DESCRIPTION
     server maps a data file and listens on a UNIX-domain socket to
     synchronize events between clients.

     client connects to a UNIX-domain socket and presents a curses(3)
     interface.

     image renders a tile from a data file using a PSF2 font to PNG on
     standard output.  To build with kcgi(3) support, copy kcgi.mk to
     config.mk.

     meta extracts metadata from a data file on standard input to CSV on
     standard ouput.  The CSV fields are tileX, tileY, createTime,
     modifyCount, modifyTime, accessCount, accessTime.

     merge interactively merges two data files data1 and data2 into data3.
     Differing tiles are presented in a curses(3) interface and are chosen by
     typing a or b.

     The arguments are as follows:

     -d data
             Set path to data file.  The default path is torus.dat.

     -f font
             Set path to PSF2 font.  The default path is default8x16.psfu.

     -h      Write help page data to standard output and exit.

     -k      Run a FastCGI worker for use with kfcgi(8).

     -p pidfile
             Daemonize and write PID to pidfile.  Only available on FreeBSD.

     -s sock
             Set path to UNIX-domain socket.  The default path is torus.sock.

     -x x    Set tile X coordinate to render.

     -y y    Set tile Y coordinate to render.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
     This software targets FreeBSD and Darwin.

     help.h contains tile data for the help page and can be generated from the
     first tile of torus.dat.

     default8x16.psfu is taken from kbd: http://kbd-project.org.
